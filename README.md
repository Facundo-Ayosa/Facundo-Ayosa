- 👋 Hi, I’m @Facundo-Ayosa
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, Data protection, 3d printing, 2d and 3d art, 3d modelling either for art or for making useful machines, machine learning, space exploration, and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web programming at "soyhenry.com", i'm interested in learning C#, Python and SQL, learn to model in 3D for 3d Printing and for develop games, and learn piano and violin.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Brainstorming, that's about all i can do right now, but i'll try to learn fast!
- 📫 How to reach me:
      - On a solar eclipse and in a perfectly flat floor, you must make a perfect circle made out of your own blood, 3cm thick circunference, diameter of 1,5 meters, with 2cm wide lines that cut the circle in 4 parts, The lines MUST point to North, East, South and West perfectly. You can start the circle whenever you like, but the blood must be fresh when the solar eclipse ends. Then, you need to go to my GitHub Account and send me a private message, I will respond as soon as I'm able to.
